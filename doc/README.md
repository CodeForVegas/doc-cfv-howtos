# Multi-language Documentation

There will almost certainly be a substantial bias toward English-language source material in this project repository. For the purposes of automated translation, the source files are authored in English and translated to other languages.

However, if there is a need or want to practice content translation to other languages (and this may include any to any translation, the presumption of English language bias need not hold).

Please indicate per-file whether it is a source document, or a translation from a source document in another language, and make that indication in the language of the localized document.

## Workflow

If a source document is revised, please perform a machine translation on the revised source document for each supported localization and commit all changes simultaneously. This will prevent source language revisions from leading their translations based on human-translation delays. The machine-translated revisions can be fixed as needed by those comfortable with a particular language, with the understanding that such fixes may be undone if a source document is revised later and includes a machine-translated revision in the particular localized document.
