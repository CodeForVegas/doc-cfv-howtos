# Multi-language Documentation

There will almost certainly be a substantial bias toward English-language source material in this project repository. For the purposes of automated translation, the source files are authored in English and translated to other languages.

However, if there is a need or want to practice content translation to other languages (and this may include any to any translation, the presumption of English language bias need not hold).

Please indicate per-file whether it is a source document, or a translation from a source document in another language, and make that indication in the language of the localized document.

## Translation Workflow

In order to be inclusive across language barriers, the documentation for this project is made translatable into other languages using the [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) tools which have, as of this writing, been made available in the organization as an application to use for any repository.
