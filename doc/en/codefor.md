# CodeFor.Vegas

The *Innovate for Vegas Foundation* has a history in its original founding in 2014 or so, and so the reboot of this organization with the same name was how we began. Over time we learned from many people that the use of the word *code* in our foundation name was sending a message, that we are about Coding and not about other things. Thus we are sending the wrong message, and this was valid criticism.

Creating two front entrances to our organization, by way of separate-but-equal portals designed to resonate with coders and creators, is the reasoning behind the two *brands* that we have established and will support moving forward. This is extra effort in some cases, but if including others in our endeavors is a difficult problem to overcome, then NOT including others is an impossible problem.

## Can I Be Part of CreateFor.Vegas?

Yes!

There are two separate entrances to the same organization. Being a part of one is being a part of the other, is being part of the whole Innovate for Vegas Foundation organization.

We do intend to tailor the personality and branding (mostly the website, logo, and general presentation of each) to reach that resonance.

We are all on the same team.

## Learning and Teaching

If you are new to coding, no worries. Over time this repository will grow with useful links and other information to add to your personal knowledge base, and collaborating with others will develop important job and work skills. Of course, the actual repositories for each project will also be useful, as reference and as a way to jump in and start!

If you are experienced and want to help those new to all of this, your expertise and time are valuable and we hope you can contribute them to the other members of Innovate for Vegas Foundation. All projects and project components will benefit from your input, not to mention the value you bring to our less-experienced volunteers!

## Attribution

One of our fundamental tenets at Innovate for Vegas Foundation is attribution. If you contribute your time and effort, if you add your creative work to project or projects, you must get credit. While this is generally the right thing to do for any volunteer organization, we are particularly interested not only in job skills development, but in actual jobs. If your work gets you noticed, and that leads to a connection or referral that leads to employment or a paying gig or anything similar, everybody wins!

The coding world has tools like git and GitHub and many more to keep track of work with attribution, but there will almost certainly be a gap between the plain old Code parts of projects, and many other contributions of creative works. Digital creation tools may or may not have features that enable easy integration with project management and revision control tools, much less attribution. We must always be aware that some valuable contribution(s) will likely not appear in a CHANGES document or a git log or other familiar format without extra effort.

We will always endeavor to keep track of and properly publish and provide attribution (unless you opt out, which is your prerogative) for all creative works contributed to Innovate for Vegas Foundation. If you identify gaps in that policy, or if you identify better methods to do so, please do not hesitate to improve our processes!

## Collaboration

The [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that applies by default to all projects and project repos, is a good starting point for exactly that. As you actually begin to work on projects, there may be some practical considerations that will make cooperation easier and more productive.

Our CodeForVegas organization has [GitLive](https://git.live/) enabled across all public repositories. If you install the appropriate extension for your editor (see their website), you will be able to collaborate with other team members using live code editing screens and chat and whatnot. We can also use other tools such as the LiveShare services offered by Microsoft, and there are others that enable remote/virtual pair programming and similar.

Each project team can settle on methods and workflow that work best for that part of a project, but generally speaking inclusion and communication should be the highest priorities. There some ideas presented in that CONTRIBUTING document, and there are likely other methods, this is where teamwork comes into play. There are the usual tools and methods associated with git GitHub (pull requests if those are a part of your team workflow, discussions, issues, projects, branches, tags, etc etc) and any other best practices that can bring non-code and non-git project elements into the mix.

It is important to always be aware that your team mates and you may have different skill and experience levels, and ideally team members will have completely orthogonal skills to build a complete project component.
