# Most Advanced Yet Acceptable

There is a common notion that the next thing must be the newest thing.

This is not always true. Were he still around we might ask one of the more prolific product designers in recent times, but we can only look at his work and his philosophy concerning how to make new things for people to use or experience.

*Learn to design for the future, while balancing your design with your users’ present stage of skills and mindset,* says Raymond Loewy.

## Raymond Loewy

While Loewy was an industrial designer, he did dabble in logo design, and was keenly aware of the user experience in general. It is worthwhile looking at how he approached some of his designs when imagining your own, whether designing software, user interface, overall user experience, logos, or just about anything that will come into contact with the people you are building your notion for.

These links are merely starting points, if you are at all interested in the bigger picture and longer story.

## Familiar Surprise

There is a rather interesting book and TED talk by journalist and author Derek Thompson, concerning the take-away notion from Loewy’s philosophy:

*He said to sell something surprising, make it familiar; and to sell something familiar, make it surprising.*

Thompson wrote an article in *The Atlantic* about Raymond Loewy and his design approach available [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/what-makes-things-cool/508772/) from which that quote was excerpted above.

The TED Talk can be found at

Use of the term *sell* here is obviously applicable to actually selling a product to a customer, new or returning, but it applies just as easily to any presentation of any product or service, free or paid, to anyone, and how they respond to it. It is the surprise of your innovation applied to a familiar thing that will lead to that *lean-in* moment, and it is the discipline of your user empathy that gently introduces your innovative surprise via something familiar to the user.

## Applying This to Your Projects

If you are new to all of this, or if you have been around for a while, your volunteer time is valuable. Trying out a radical idea is interesting and not discouraged by any means, but it is worthwhile to explore, as a potential alternative or as a path to deploying a final version of the radical notion, the possibility of MAYA to avoid scaring off or confusing or otherwise frustrating the people who will make use of your creativity.

If we use the typical example project topic, Open Transit, suppose you have a great idea for a new way to show a transit user where the bus or bike they are looking for is at present, including perhaps a map and a time and an arrival stop location and perhaps some other information. The RTC of Southern Nevada presently (as this was written) depends on a mobile application called TransitApp to convey this rider experience, your idea may well obsolete that application overnight!

Or, what if this great new idea is so new, that it take some time to become familiar with. Transit users will almost certainly make use of this new tool at the time(s) they are waiting to use public transportation to get to work, to get home, to get to school, maybe to get to a hospital to visit a loved one, who can say? One potential strategy is to offer your innovations as *surprises* within a *familiar* interface, which may actually look and feel a lot like the platform you want to supplant.

The thing to consider is not the patience required to restrain yourself from unleashing your full maelstrom of creativity, but the *ah-ha* moments that will excite a transit user out there who is running late and trying to navigate your tools to get to where they need to be, finding everything where they usually found it before, and yet still seeing that something is oddly more helpful, more useful more empathetic.

This same approach can be taken with logo design, content creation, physical or industrial design, user interface design… make it familiar, and surprise them!
