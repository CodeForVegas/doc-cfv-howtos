# Contributing For…

From the Code for America legacy among civic volunteer cohorts (called brigades), there was a substantial amount of focus on the Coding or the Tech that made up any particular undertaking, without so much consideration of the other important contributions and most important of course, *Contributors* to these. Whether adding code or tackling many of the other essential pieces, all are contributors and the whole team must be recognized for these. Some contributors might be working with code, while other contributors might be working on visualizations and user interfaces or mechanical designs, and yet other contributors might be testing, engaging with the greater community for co-creation efforts, managing and coordination volunteer effort, not to mention promoting outreach and engagement with other cohorts and organizations, and the list goes on.

## Public Features

Recognition and Celebration of Civic Volunteers and the Entities to which they contribute (Initiatives, Component Projects, Mentoring, Learning, and so on) is extremely important. Too often, according to many anecdotes and perhaps even found in the CONTRIBUTORS files of some project repositories out there, the non-code contributors have not always received the same attribution and celebration as the coders, and this is not good.

While our website at *InnovateForVegas.org* is focused on our organization, 501(c)(3) status, governance, and general overview and links, we secured a domain some time ago to focus on those contributing their volunteer time, effort, and expertise to elevate their and our communities. While one does not need to Innovate *IN* Vegas, one is invited to Innovate *For.vegas* , and it is here we publish and maintain the recognition and celebration of our contributors, our volunteers, our interested and interesting people who make things go and so make a difference.

## Learning and Teaching

If you are new to any aspect of open source civic volunteer participation, no worries. Over time the documentation found in this HOWTO repository (and surely elsewhere over more time) will grow with useful links and other information to add to your personal knowledge base, and collaborating with others will develop important job, work, and life skills. Of course, the actual repositories for each Component Project within each Initiative will also be useful, as reference and as a way to jump in and start!

If you are experienced and want to help those new to all of this, your time, effort, and expertise are valuable and we hope you can contribute them to the other contributors and teams within and adjacent to the Innovate for Vegas Foundation. All Initiatives and Component Projects will benefit from your input, regardless of experience level, not to mention the value you bring to our less-experienced volunteers and the lessons they will provide in return!

## Attribution

One of our fundamental tenets at Innovate for Vegas Foundation is Attribution. If you contribute your time, effort, and expertise, if you add your creative work to an Entity or Entities, you must get credit. While this is generally the right thing to do for any volunteer organization, we are particularly interested not only in community elevation and job skills development, but in actual jobs (personal elevation!) and other such activities which benefit from a great CV and great references. If your effort gets you noticed, and that leads to a connection or referral that leads to employment or a paying gig or anything similar, everybody wins! This includes our own Initiatives if they do happen to matriculate to Labs or similar deployment…

The coding world has tools like git and GitHub and many more to keep track of work with attribution, but there will be a gap between the plain old Code parts of Entities, and many other contributions of creative works. Digital creation tools may or may not have features that enable easy integration with project management and revision control tools, much less attribution. We must always be aware that some valuable contribution(s) will likely not appear in a CHANGES document or a git log or other familiar format without extra effort.

We will *always* endeavor to keep track of and properly publish and provide attribution (unless you opt out, which is your prerogative) for all creative works contributed to Innovate for Vegas Foundation. If you identify gaps in that policy, or if you identify better methods to do so, please do not hesitate to improve or suggest improvements to our processes!

We will make that extra effort, we ask that you do as well.

## Collaboration

The Innovate for Vegas Foundation [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that applies by default to all Entities and Entity Repositories, is a good starting point for exactly that. As you actually begin to work on any Entity (perhaps suggesting some changes to this HOWTO repository), to make contributions, there may be some practical considerations that will make cooperation easier and more productive.

The CONTRIBUTING document is evolving to account for external and team member contributions, copyright and licensing and clarity regarding who owns what and what happens with contributions. Most important, contribution of creative works is not a matter of contributing software source code, but may be any number of other types of contribution at what we could refer to as the other end of any spectrum from where source code might be. Hardware designs, mechanical designs, user interface, media, iconography, documentation, language translations, outreach and story-telling, co-creation engagement, and the list goes on. Collaboration on contributions is important for attribution, where all those individuals involved in any particular contribution get credit and recognition for their work for the rest of the world to see.

Each Entity Team can settle on methods and workflow that work best for that part of an Initiative (ie for each Component Project), but generally speaking inclusion and communication should be the highest priorities. This is also true between Entities and Entity Teams (across an Initiative, and across our entire organization), in that the parts should fit together and work together, and the same could be said of the volunteers contributing their time, effort, and expertise along the way.

It is important to always be aware that your teammates and you may have different skill and experience levels, and ideally team members will have orthogonal skills to build a complete Entity component, whatever it may be.

## Last Word

The Innovate for Vegas Foundation has a stated purpose, filed in our legal documents and driving our mission and processes. That purpose is

> To enable and encourage ideation, innovation, and implementation to make our communities better.

Our goals are not a focus on coding or content creation, though these are included along with any number of other types of creative work. All Entities will benefit from contribution of time, effort, and expertise, and that includes creativity and diversity of background and knowledge of various civic volunteers from all corners; not everything is *code* (software development), for example, and not everything requires *code*, practicality and reality will dictate the requirements of any particular Entity; this notion applies to all aspects of any effort, where coding, creating, testing, documenting, translating, promoting, supporting, and iterating all require different perspectives and different skills.

Some of those may be yours!
