# Creating and Coding and Contributing

Often there is a substantial amount of focus on the Coding or the Tech that makes any particular initiative, startup, and so on, without so much regard for the other essential elements, contributions, and most important of course, *Contributors* to these. Contributors might be working with code and technologies that make up a component project, while other Contributors might be working on visualizations and user interfaces or mechanical designs, and yet other Contributors might be testing, engaging with the greater community for co-creation efforts, project management, outreach and engagement with other cohorts and organizations, and the list goes on.

## Public Features

Recognition and Celebration of Civic Volunteers and Entities (Initiatives, Component Projects, and so on) to which they contribute is important. One part of this overall effort is the maintenance of public-facing feature web properties that showcase entities, contributors, and outcomes (such as comments from the communities benefiting from these works). Previously, the Innovate for Vegas Foundation had secured two internet domain names for these purposes, *CodeFor.vegas* and *CreateFor.vegas* with the intent to enable technical development of these by contributors leaning toward technical implementation, and presentation and content by those leaning toward creative implementation. This proved to be confusing for some, especially where one might not be obviously in one or the other categories. Why categorize anyway?

In order to enable more flexibility, we traded the two domains above for the much less specific *For.vegas* internet domain, where we can accomplish similar goals mentioned above, and more, without preconceived notions that come with rigid names like CodeFor and CreateFor.

Where the *InnovateForVegas.org* internet domain is the the business side of our foundation (that is, featuring nonprofit corporation, governance, tax exempt, and other business-oriented information), our other web properties will ideally feature the individuals, teams, and projects that make our organization goâ€¦

## Learning and Teaching

If you are new to any aspect of open source civic volunteer participation, no worries. Over time the documentation found in this HOWTO repository (or others added as needed) will grow with useful links and other information to add to your personal knowledge base, and collaborating with others will develop important job, work, and life skills. Of course, the actual repositories for each project will also be useful, as reference and as a way to jump in and start!

If you are experienced and want to help those new to all of this, your expertise and time are valuable and we hope you can contribute them to the other members of Innovate for Vegas Foundation. All Initiatives and Component Projects will benefit from your input, not to mention the value you bring to our less-experienced volunteers!

## Attribution

One of our fundamental tenets at Innovate for Vegas Foundation is attribution. If you contribute your time, effort, and expertise, if you add your creative work to an Entity or Entities, you must get credit. While this is generally the right thing to do for any volunteer organization, we are particularly interested not only in community elevation and job skills development, but in actual jobs (personal elevation!). If your work gets you noticed, and that leads to a connection or referral that leads to employment or a paying gig or anything similar, everybody wins!

The coding world has tools like git and GitHub and many more to keep track of work with attribution, but there will be a gap between the plain old Code parts of Entities, and many other contributions of creative works. Digital creation tools may or may not have features that enable easy integration with project management and revision control tools, much less attribution. We must always be aware that some valuable contribution(s) will likely not appear in a CHANGES document or a git log or other familiar format without extra effort.

We will always endeavor to keep track of and properly publish and provide attribution (unless you opt out, which is your prerogative) for all creative works contributed to Innovate for Vegas Foundation. If you identify gaps in that policy, or if you identify better methods to do so, please do not hesitate to improve our processes!

We will make that extra effort, we ask that you do as well.

## Collaboration

The Innovate for Vegas Foundation [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that applies by default to all Entities and Entity Repositories, is a good starting point for exactly that. As you actually begin to work on any Entity, to make contributions, there may be some practical considerations that will make cooperation easier and more productive.

The CONTRIBUTING document is evolving to account for external and team member contributions, copyright and licensing and clarity regarding who owns what and what happens with contributions. Most important, contribution of creative works is not a matter of contributing software source code, but may be any number of other types of contribution at the other end of any spectrum from where source code might be. Hardware designs, mechanical designs, user interface, media, iconography, documentation, language translations, and the list goes on. Collaboration on contributions is important for attribution, where all those involved in any particular contribution get credit for their work and attribution for the rest of the world to see.

Each Entity Team can settle on methods and workflow that work best for that part of a project, but generally speaking inclusion and communication should be the highest priorities. This is also true between Entities and Entity Teams, in that the parts should fit together and work together, and the same could be said of the volunteers contributing their time, effort, and expertise along the way.

It is important to always be aware that your teammates and you may have different skill and experience levels, and ideally team members will have orthogonal skills to build a complete Entity component.

## Last Word

The Innovate for Vegas Foundation has a stated purpose, filed in our legal documents and driving our mission and processes. That purpose is

> To enable and encourage ideation, innovation, and implementation to make our communities better.

Our goals are not a focus on coding or content creation, though these are included along with any number of other types of creative work. Most, perhaps all projects will benefit from contribution of time, effort, and expertise, and that includes creativity and diversity of background and knowledge of various civic volunteers from all corners; not everything is *code* (software development), for example, and not everything requires *code*, practicality and reality are somewhere in the middle, and this applies to all aspects of any Initiative, where coding, creating, testing, documenting, translating, promoting, supporting, and iterating all require different perspectives and different skills.

Some of those may be yours!
