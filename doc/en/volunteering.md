# Volunteering Your Time

Volunteering for anything is always a challenge. The rewards are often self-actualized, ideally as a result of helping others, and this is an important part of what we are attempting to accomplish with Innovate for Vegas Foundation.

Externally, and mostly for legal reasons, there are roles filled within this Foundation such as President and Treasurer and Directors on our Board, required for the formation of a Nevada Nonprofit Corporation and to operate as a 501(c)(3) public charity, among other things (and there are indeed other things). Internally, however, our Foundation is organized as a non-hierarchy, where no one individual works for any other individual. There are those who will take leadership roles when appropriate, perhaps based on time availability, a particular expertise that applies to some Initiative or Component Project, or perhaps a desire to drive a particular component directly. At the same time, some will participate in various ways when they can, and so it is possible a specific leadership role will migrate from one person to another, perhaps based on time, or on a particular issue, or other factors.

Do our Initiatives and other Entities *require* management infrastructure? Is there a need for a *managerial hierarchy* or other specific infrastructure? Perhaps in some cases. When there are individuals willing to take on those roles, it will be a worthwhile consideration, especially as participation grows with time. In a startup scenario, it is often up to individual contributors to take leadership roles, if temporarily, to advance a project or particular issue. With more participation and more to do, direction and oversight from those taking those responsibilities will likely be valuable, with the understanding that our Whole Team is not a reporting hierarchy per se.

Please see the [OrgChart](orgchart.md) document for ideas and information about organization and structure of Initiatives and Component Project teams.

One of the primary goals of our Foundation, from an operational perspective, is to transparently attribute volunteer effort (contribution of creative work or other activities) to respective volunteers, so that anyone curious can find out easily who is making a difference. The resulting development of job skills and the elevation of our communities at large through our efforts will, if all goes to plan, bring that self-actualized reward, and attribution is an important part of the effort individually and as an organization.

## Entrepreneurialism and Collaboration

There are two critical components to volunteering your time for our various projects and activities:

1. You should be [Dictionary: Entrepreneurial](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entrepreneurial) or at least be willing to consider this approach to your and our endeavors. Taking the initiative to do something that needs to be done without waiting for others to do it for you, will be a job skill, and a life skill, that you can take with you anywhere. Many will believe this term is used to describe someone who is starting a business, and it is, but this Entrepreneurial quality is *also* found in people who make things happen.

2. You should be willing to Collaborate, or work together, to accomplish goals, learn, and teach, share, and succeed. If collaboration on projects is something you are not used to doing, all of our Entities (Initiatives, Component Projects, etc) and activities will benefit from collaboration, and you can become comfortable doing so along the way. Sometimes collaboration is made easier with tools like GitHub or PenPot or other (open source!) tools, but it starts with an attitude that *team* has real value, starting with one individual valuing the time, effort, and expertise of another.

The practiced abilities to identify a contribution one can make to an Initiative or Component Project or anything else for that matter, to work with members of a team to coordinate the collaboration, and then execute that contribution to advance the effort, are invaluable, not only to the Entities and others on your team(s), but to you.

## Volunteer Effort Is Gold

And so we let it shine!

If you are new to volunteering your time and efforts to Open Source projects (which are typically thought of as only software or coding projects, but no, this is not the case), there are many benefits that you will realize over time, stated very usefully and expansively in the link below. Before you click away to read over this useful guide, please keep these specific things in mind with regard to this Foundation:

- Job Skills Development is a high-priority goal
- Community Elevation is a high-priority goal
- Our purpose is *To Enable and Encourage Ideation, Innovation, and Implementation to make our communities better*. (This is our legally-published purpose which embodies the first two high-priority goals, and more)_.

How we accomplish these is not a matter of a startup business plan receiving venture capital funding to deliver products or services. This is a group effort, powered by volunteers like you, working with other volunteers like you, in ways that may not be immediately obvious. Please take a moment and read through this external document below if you need some ideas how to volunteer your time, effort, and expertise to our open source projects and goals:

[Open Source Guide: How to Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

Maintaining and adding to our own Howto documents, one of which you have read right here, is just one of many, many ways you can volunteer your time and effort with this Foundation and your peersâ€¦
