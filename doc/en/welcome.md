# Welcome to Code for Vegas Foundation

So you want to volunteer your time to make our communities better? You have come to the right place.

## Getting started

While there is great flexibility in the onboarding workflow, the general order of operations is something like this:

1. Read the following documents and ask questions if you have any.
   1. [Code of Conduct - Code for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   2. [Contributing - Code for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Join the CodeForVegas organization on GitHub.
      1. If you have no idea what this is, read about [GitHub](github.md) and git first, then come back here!
      2. If you do not already have a GitHub account, please sign up for one! It will be useful for many things, even if you are more interested in CreateFor.Vegas than CodeFor.Vegas and do not consider yourself a *coder* since we are using GitHub for project management and discussions.
      3. Share your GitHub username to [Addme + GitHub @ codeforvegas.org](mailto:addme+github@codeforvegas.org) to be added to the CodeForVegas organization on GitHub.
      4. Please do try to participate in the various projects which you find interesting, including reading announcements and discussions which relate to the areas you find interesting and wish to contribute to.
3. Share your email address for our mailing list at [Addme @ codeforvegas.org](mailto:addme@codeforvegas.org). This is optional, but encouraged.
4. Generate a PGP/GPG Key Pair for use on GitHub and for secure email, among other things.
5. Join our self-hosted messaging server (Matrix) with a client of your choice
6. Pick your project(s) and join a project team to commence creative work!

The first few steps are rather simple, that last one is where the real fun begins.

## A Brief Interruption

“It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.” —William L. Watkinson, 1907

If you are new to the open source volunteer space, please take a moment and note these, keeping in mind as well that all of this Foundation is powered by volunteers, no matter what role they are playing. Their time and your time are contributed toward our Foundation goals, you will be working *with* your peers, not *for* anyone. Work on projects with this Foundation are not jobs, you are as empowered to contribute and collaborate as anyone else and you are encouraged to do so!

If you do feel the need to compose an angry comment or private message about anything we work on or the way we do so, please first consider these:

1. Read these Howto documents. If you are not Github-familiar, one of the things we need to do is adapt processes for those new to, or not interested in, use of tools such as that, to the extent it is reasonable to do. Offer up a discussion, issue, pull request, maybe even a whole new doc to add to the collection. Backlog and other project-related particulars are in here, it is important to read first, then light your keyboard on fire with hot takes. Better, do not spend time on hot takes…
2. Show up. Virtually or in-person, be a part of conversations and contribute to them, find out who needs what, maybe you can help. 100% of the effort spent complaining about what isn’t being done for you can be spent on addressing what needs to be done.
3. If you are not comfortable with making things from scratch (whatever it may be), the projects and direction of this Foundation may not be for you. Please depart quietly in that case, there is no shame in a mismatch. Just don't set the place on fire with your smoldering keyboard on your way.

## Next Steps

Perhaps the most important thing to know is that your volunteer time is valuable, to you and to Code for Vegas Foundation and its members. We will always be attempting to integrate into our workflows and methodologies, the inclusion of specific attribution to you for your contributions, directory or indirectly, to any of our projects or undertakings. Sometimes this will include references to GitHub or git commits and that type of code project participation, but often this is not applicable. Making this notion compatible with all contributions and effort towards our projects is the highest priority, please be proactive in noting where we are missing something here and help us fix that!

As an extension of this awareness of the value of your time, we typically plan projects for month-long focus, with a weekend hackathon meetup each month as one opportunity to collaborate with other organization members. As well you should feel empowered to meet with others on a particular project which interests you, any time you like, and not only within the month of focus on that project. All projects are ongoing, with different components of different projects always subject to continuing development. Hop on and hop off when you are able and when you need to.

### New Project Ideas

Once your are familiar with some of the projects and teams, and what the overarching goals are (capstone projects, but more importantly job skills development, job creation, and general community elevation in our locality and beyond) of Code for Vegas Foundation, the time will come when you may want to suggestion a top-level project that could fit into one of the capstone focus areas, or maybe a project that is important but not necessarily in keeping with the general focus of a capstone we already have.

We do not as of this document revision date, have a formal project proposal process, so a great start is to attend a hackathon meetup or other group gathering, or join a discussion on the messaging server, and commence suggesting!

### Day-to-Day Team Collaboration

There is a growing number of current projects to work on, if you would like to contribute to one or more of these existing endeavors you are more than welcome to do so. In order that we can be as inclusive as possible, we tend to focus over a month-long period on a new project focus, with ideation and possibly innovation at the Monthly Hackathon Meetup. This does not mean that all participation must take place at the hackathon meetup. Quite the opposite.

If you would like to spend some time now and then, a few minutes each day, a few hours on a Friday, join a project team at a coffee shop on a Saturday, or whatever fits your schedule and commitment level, that is how Code for Vegas Foundation operates. Your volunteer time is valuable to all of the other volunteers adding their time and energy to each and every undertaking!

As you may find as you participate more and more, collaborating with people in the real world with their own schedules can be a challenge. Making that work so that all involved can make forward progress is a skill worth developing for all of your future endeavors, with Code for Vegas Foundation or other entities near and far.

There will be specific documents in this repository with ideas, tools, and methods for collaboration, whether virtual or in-person.

## This Repository

As with all repositories in the CodeForVegas GitHub organization , and all projects that are part of the Code for Vegas Foundation, this repository will be made better if you contribute to it. If you are not comfortable working with Markdown documents (files on GitHub ending with .md will tend to be Markdown), please join a discussion or create an issue in this repository so that edits, additions, or other changes can be made. The Open Source approach is in full effect, *If you see a problem, Fix it*. Or at least, tell someone about it.

## Read On

This document is an introduction to get started, there is a living directory of onboarding information here to help get up and running.

It deserves repeating, if you see something missing anywhere in this repository that you feel could help the next person to come up to speed and participate in any of our various projects, or if you see anything in any of our projects that could use some fixing or enhancement, this is what we are doing, and you are absolutely invited to be a part of that.

So Welcome to Code for Vegas Foundation and we look forward to your participation, read through the rest of the documents here and definitely collaborate with your fellow members!
