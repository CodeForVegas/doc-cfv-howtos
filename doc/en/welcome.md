# Welcome to Code for Vegas Foundation

So you want to volunteer your time to make our communities better? You have come to the right place.

## Getting started

While there is great flexibility in the onboarding workflow, the general order of operations is something like this:

1. Read the following documents and ask questions if you have any.
   1. [Code of Conduct - Code for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   2. [Contributing - Code for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Join the CodeForVegas organization on GitHub.
      1. If you do not already have a GitHub account, please sign up for one! It will be useful for many things, even if you are more interested in CreateFor.Vegas than CodeFor.Vegas and do not consider yourself a *coder* since we are using GitHub for project management and discussions.
      2. Please do try to participate in the various projects which you find interesting, including reading annoucements and discissions which relate to the areas you find interesting and wish to contribute to.
3. Share your email address for our mailing list at addme@codeforvegas.org . This is optional, but encouraged.
4. Generate a PGP/GPG Key Pair for use on GitHub and for secure email, among other things.
5. Join our self-hosted messaging server (Matrix) with a client of your choice
6. Pick your project(s) and join a project team to commence creative work!

The first few steps are rather simple, that last one is where the real fun begins.

## Next Steps

### New Project Ideas

Once your are familiar with some of the projects and teams, and what the overarching goals are (capstone projects, but more importantly job skills development, job creation, and general community elevation in our locality and beyond) of Code for Vegas Foundation, the time will come when you may want to suggestion a top-level project that could fit into one of the capstone focus areas, or maybe a project that is important but not necessarily in keeping with the general focus of a capstone we already have.

We do not as of this document revision date, have a formal project proposal process, so a great start is to attend a hackathon meetup or other group gathering, or join a discussion on the messaging server, and commence suggesting!

### Day-to-Day Collaboration

There is a growing number of current projects to work on, if you would like to contribute to one or more of these existing endeavors you are more than welcome to do so. In order that we can be as inclusive as possible, we tend to focus over a month-long period on a new project focus, with ideation and possibly innovation at the Monthly Hackathon Meetup. This does not mean that all participation must take place at the hackathon meetup. Quite the opposite.

If you would like to spend some time now and then, a few minutes each day, a few hours on a Friday, join a project team at a coffee shop on a Saturday, or whatever fits your schedule and committment level, that is how Code for Vegas Foundatin operates. Your volunteer time is valuable to all of the other volunteers adding their time and energy to each and every undertaking!
