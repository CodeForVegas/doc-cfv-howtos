# Agile for Volunteers (has moved…)

Agile methodologies were developed by software developers for software developers and the infrastructure in which the business of software development takes place.

The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is the fundamental description of what Agile was conceived to be; we can start with one slight modification here:

> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working *projects* over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan
>  
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
>

We can focus on a whole-team approach across project and project focus areas, rather than considering only the software parts. A project may include zero software, but we may attempt to follow Agile methods in developing that project nevertheless.

## New Component Project Repository

We have created a separate, more detailed component of our Infrastructure Initiative.

Please visit the [Agile for Volunteers Repository](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/doc-agile-for-volunteers) for more detail, example workflow templates, and more!
