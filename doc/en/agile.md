# Agile for Volunteers (has moved…)

Agile methodologies were developed by software developers for software developers and the infrastructure in which the business of software development takes place.

The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is the fundamental description of what Agile was conceived to be, or rather, what those who adopt an Agile approach could begin with, to turn it into what works for them; we can start with one slight modification here:

> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working *projects* over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan
>  
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We can focus on a whole-team approach across Entities (Initiatives, Component Projects, and other such things) and various focus areas, rather than considering only the software parts. Any Entity may include zero software, but we shall endeavor to apply Agile, and specifically Agile for Volunteers methods in developing that Entity nevertheless.

## New Component Project Repository

We have created a separate, more detailed component of our Infrastructure Initiative as we continue focus on our own development and use of Agile for Volunteers.

## New Initiative Org and Website

In order to bring Agile for Volunteers to a larger audience, whether civic volunteer organizations or other volunteer-powered cohorts and efforts, we hope that more adopters will mean more contribution of new ideas.
