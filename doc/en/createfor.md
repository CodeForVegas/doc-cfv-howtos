# CreateFor.Vegas

The *Code for Vegas Foundation* has a history in its original founding in 2014 or so, and so the reboot of this organization with the same name was how we began. Over time we learned from many people that the use of the word *code* in our foundation name was sending a message, that we are about Coding and not about other things. Thus we are sending the wrong message, and this was valid criticism.

Creating two front entrances to our organization, by way of separate-but-equal portals designed to resonate with coders and creators, is the reasoning behind the two *brands* that we have established and will support moving forward. This is extra effort in some cases, but if including others in our endeavors is a difficult problem to overcome, then NOT including others is an impossible problem.

## Can I Be Part of CodeFor.Vegas?

Yes!

There are two separate entrances to the same organization. Being a part of one is being a part of the other, is being part of the whole Code for Vegas Foundation organization.

We do intend to tailor the personality and branding (mostly the website, logo, and general presentation of each) to reach that resonance.

We are all on the same team.

## Learning and Teaching

If you are a new creator, no worries. Over time this repository will grow with useful links and other information to add to your personal knowledge base, and as well there are many ways to develop your personal job and work skills by working on projects and collaborating with others on all aspects of our various projects.

If you are experienced and want to help those new to all of this, your expertise and time are valuable and we hope you can contribute them to the other members of Code for Vegas Foundation. All projects and project components will benefit from your input, not to mention the value you bring to our less-experienced volunteers!

## Attribution

One of our fundamental tenets at Code for Vegas Foundation is attribution. If you contribute your time and effort, if you add your creative work to project or projects, you must get credit. While this is generally the right thing to do for any volunteer organization, we are particularly interested not only in job skills development, but in actual jobs. If your work gets you noticed, and that leads to a connection or referral that leads to employment or a paying gig or anything similar, everybody wins!

In the coding world, it is relatively easy to attach a name and other contact information to a code file, and to changes to that code file. GitHub makes that pretty easy, and there are other tools that do similar things. Open Source Software Development and Attribution go hand-in-hand. This is not so often true with the other parts of most projects and products, where artwork and other words, pictures, audio, and video are sometimes presented with production attribution obscured. Digital content creation and editing tools are not always built to connect to a larger project with detailed contribution attribution, and while audio and video production will often contain production credits, logos and signage and any number of creative works are often used without easily-discovered attribution.

We will always endeavor to keep track of and properly publish and provide attribution (unless you opt out, which is your prerogative) for all creative works contributed to Code for Vegas Foundation. If you identify gaps in that policy, or if you identify better methods to do so, please do not hesitate to improve our processes!

## Collaboration

The [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that applies by default to all projects and project repos, is a good starting point for exactly that. As you actually begin to work on projects, there may be some practical considerations that will make cooperation easier and more productive.

Most of that document is skewed more to the use of collaboration tools on the Coder side, as there are many established methods and workflows and tools and so on. Best practices for creation and maintenance of other types of creative works (even electronic hardware, which is a design process with its own challenges not like software development) are likely known best by those more experienced with, say, audio production, or content authoring, or even analog artwork creation.

Each project team can settle on methods and workflow that work best for that part of a project, but generally speaking inclusion and communication should be the highest priorities. There some ideas presented in that CONTRIBUTING document, and there are likely other methods, this is where teamwork comes into play. Your coding teammates can make use of the usual code collaboration tools but it will be useful and educational for your team and other project teams to integrate other workflows and methods into something that works across disciplines.

It is important to always be aware that your teammates and you may have different skill and experience levels, and ideally team members will have completely orthogonal skills to build a complete project component.
