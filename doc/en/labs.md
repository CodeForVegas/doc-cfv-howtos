# Deploying Initiatives to Labs

The concept of releasing software in an infrastructure labeled as being a “Lab” is not uncommon. Google Labs, Apache Labs, Oracle Labs, Pinterest Labs, Strava Labs, and more, the notion is to deploy beta products based on Initiatives that may or may not be completely ready for prime time, setting expectations for the users of these deployed products and Initiatives accordingly. They should work, they might sometimes not, and they may change over time, ideally for the better.

The notion of a Innovate for Vegas Foundation Labs deployment scheme will enable our volunteers to get Initiatives in front of members of our communities (here in Las Vegas where we are based, and beyond) to try, regardless of whether there are formal arrangements to support Initiatives with municipal partners and related agencies, which we cover more in [jobs](jobs.md).

An important component of any Labs deployments is that interaction with people from our larger communities, who may find real value in what we do together (and perhaps your contributions specifically) and who would like to take part in a co-creation effort to join in on the development process directly. As always, this does not always mean joining in on coding, but may include suggestions for content, documentation, user interface, an so much more.

## Compensation

The Labs business model is intended to enable a path to supporting the Innovate for Vegas Foundation civic volunteer efforts through subscriptions, advertising, or other revenue generating means. Where the Innovate for Vegas Foundation is a nonprofit entity (and, eventually, a public charity), the open source creative works contributed by Innovate for Vegas Foundation volunteers may be used to deploy actual products, to generate revenue, and support the Innovate for Vegas Foundation and the contributors to the relevant products.

Since the Labs deployment is a separate entity at what is called *arm’s length* from the foundation itself, there are no legal limitations on how and how much revenue is generated, and where the revenue is dispersed. It will be made clear that the Labs deployments are *Powered by Innovate for Vegas Foundation Volunteers*, and where possible and with permission of the individual contributors, attribution and ideally, some form of revenue per individual. Obviously this will depend a great deal on the end user appeal, whether software, hardware, media, or other creative work.
