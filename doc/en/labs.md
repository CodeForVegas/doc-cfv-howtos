# Deploying Projects to Labs

The concept of releasing software in an infrastructure labeled as being a “lab” is not uncommon. Google Labs, Apache Labs, and the list goes on, the notion is to deploy beta products based on projects that may or may not be completely ready for prime time, setting expectations for the users of these deployed products. They should work, they might sometimes not, and they may change over time, ideally for the better.

The notion of a Innovate for Vegas Foundation Labs deployment scheme will enable our volunteers to get projects in front of members of our communities (here in Las Vegas where we are based, and beyond) to try, regardless of whether there are formal arrangements to support projects with municipal partners and related agencies, which we will cover more in [jobs](jobs.md).

## Compensation

The Labs business model is intended to enable a path to supporting the Innovate for Vegas Foundation civic volunteer efforts through subscriptions, advertising, or other revenue generating means. Where the Innovate for Vegas Foundation is a nonprofit entity (and, eventually, a public charity), the open source creative works contributed by Innovate for Vegas Foundation volunteers may be used to deploy actual products, to generate revenue, and support the Innovate for Vegas Foundation and the contributors to the relevant products.

Since the Labs deployment is a separate entity at what is called *arm’s length* from the foundation itself, there are no legal limitations on how and how much revenue is generated, and where the revenue is dispersed. It will be made clear that the Labs deployments are *Powered by Innovate for Vegas Foundation* or perhaps *Powered by CodeFor.Vegas* and *Powered by CreateFor.Vegas*, and where possible and with permission of the individual contributors, attribution and ideally, some form of revenue per individual. Obviously this will depend a great deal on the end user appeal, whether software, hardware, media, or other creative work.
